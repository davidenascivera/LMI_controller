# LMI-Based Controller Design

This repository contains the project files for designing an LMI-based controller to ensure system stability and optimal performance. The controller is derived by linearizing the system, formulating stability criteria as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), and solving these inequalities to find a feedback gain matrix. The project includes both the theoretical background and simulation results.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Design an LMI-based controller to ensure system stability and minimal control effort.
- **Methodology**: The system is linearized, and LMIs are formulated to meet the control objectives. The resulting LMIs are solved using numerical solvers to compute the feedback gain matrix.
- **Results**: The controller's performance is validated through simulations to ensure the system is stable and performs efficiently.
